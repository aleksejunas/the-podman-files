# Theme Functionality Refactor Summary

## Overview

The theme functionality in the project was refactored to improve
maintainability, consistency, and usability. The changes centralized
theme management, simplified the `ThemeSwitcher` component, and ensured
dynamic theme switching without requiring a browser reload.

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized Theme Logic

- Created a `ThemeContext` in `src/components/theme/ThemeContext.tsx` to
  manage theme state and logic.
- The `ThemeContext` provides the current theme and a function to update
  the theme (`setTheme`).
- The `ThemeProvider` wraps the application to ensure the theme context
  is available throughout the component tree.
- Integrated with the existing `switchTheme` function from
  `utils/ThemeSwitcher.ts` to ensure consistent theme application.

### 2. Refactored `ThemeSwitcher`

- Updated the `ThemeSwitcher` component to use the centralized
  `ThemeContext`.
- Removed redundant local state and logic from `ThemeSwitcher`.
- Simplified the component to dynamically update the theme using the
  `setTheme` function from `ThemeContext`.

### 3. Updated `Navbar`

- Removed the unused `onThemeChange` prop and the redundant
  `handleThemeChange` function from `Navbar.tsx`.
- Ensured the `ThemeSwitcher` in the navbar uses the centralized
  `ThemeContext`.

### 4. Fixed Dynamic Theme Switching

- Updated `tailwind.config.ts` to use `darkMode: ["attribute",
"data-theme"]`.
- Set the `data-theme` attribute directly on the `document.documentElement`
  (`<html>` element).
- Added a dynamic `key={theme}` prop in `AppNavigator.tsx` to force a
  complete re-render when the theme changes.

### 5. Debugging and Testing

- Added debug logs to verify that the `data-theme` attribute is being set
  correctly.
- Added a test element in `index.html` to confirm that Tailwind CSS
  dynamically applies styles based on the `data-theme` attribute.

## How It Works Now

- The `ThemeProvider` initializes the theme from `localStorage` and
  updates the `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element whenever the
  theme changes.
- The `ThemeSwitcher` component allows users to select a theme, which
  updates the `ThemeContext` and dynamically applies the new theme styles.
- The `AppContent` component in `AppNavigator.tsx` uses the theme as a
  key to force a complete re-render when the theme changes.
- Tailwind CSS uses the `data-theme` attribute to apply theme-specific
  styles dynamically.
- The original `switchTheme` function from `utils/ThemeSwitcher.ts` is
  used in conjunction with the new context system to ensure compatibility.

## Benefits

- Centralized and consistent theme management.
- Simplified and reusable `ThemeSwitcher` component.
- Dynamic theme switching with immediate visual feedback.
- Improved maintainability and scalability of the theming system.
- Better user experience with no need to manually refresh the browser.

79: 1. **Line Wrapping**: Long lines were broken into shorter ones to comply
80: with the 80-character limit. This improves readability and adheres to
81: Markdown linting rules.
82: 2. **Formatting**: Indentation and line breaks were added to nested lists
